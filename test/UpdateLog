2021.2.5-2021.2.25
Make Progress:
1. fix existed times count bug, it's because erase elements when traverse map STL.
2. notice previous code only traces cpu cache once for 5 seconds, 
   maybe some hugepages only have few objects, and quickly leave cpu cache, so we can't capture these hugepages.
   Now trace by traverse huge_page_filler. 
   The result is this only adds few hugepages, so it doesn't matter.
3. test several tests. redis and phoronix-test.
   redis proved that high frag of tcmalloc in high concurrent request, or maybe in quite random request.

Problem:
1. All tests of phoronix-test use little memory, like ai-benchmark, stream, cachebench.
2. If there are free pages, they are either in huge_cache or in huge_page_filler, but why in huge_cache?
   How does huge_cache work and how to traverse hugepages in it?
3. Don't know how to use tcmalloc in CloudSuite.
------------------------------------------ 
2021.2.26-2021.3.4
Make Progress:
1. test redis-server rather than redis-benchmark, and still shows high fragmentation.
2. come back to cpu cache trace
3. remove needless tests. I think previous tests don't have peak and trough. Although they malloc and free for a lot of times, they maintain a stable memory usage.
--------------------------------------------
2021.3.5-2021.3.11
Progress:
1. Increase redis memory consumption, show extremely high fragmentation
2. Combine old tensorflow tests, and have peaks and troughs
3. Use rough stats of hugepages instead of listing them

Problem:
1. Bugs running empirical_driver
2. Haven't build and test firefox successfully
